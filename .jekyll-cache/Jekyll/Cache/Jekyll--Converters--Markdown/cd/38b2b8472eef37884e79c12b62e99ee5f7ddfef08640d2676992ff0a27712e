I"Ï<p>We invite submissions of <strong>extended abstracts</strong> and <strong>live demonstrations</strong> showcasing novel work in on-sensor and near-sensor vision. This is an opportunity to present early-stage research, works-in-progress, recently published results, or hardware prototypes to an audience of researchers working at the intersection of computer vision, computer architecture, and embedded systems.</p>
