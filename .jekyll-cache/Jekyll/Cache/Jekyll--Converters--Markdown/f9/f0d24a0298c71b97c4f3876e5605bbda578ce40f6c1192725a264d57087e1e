<p>Computer Vision is moving to the edge - into drones, robots, IoT devices, AR/VR headsets and autonomous systems. These applications demand processing that is fast, energy-efficient, and privacy-preserving. On-sensor vision adresses these challenges by unifying sensing and computation on a single chip, producing information-rich outputs instead of raw pixel data.</p>

<p>In modern computing systems, data movement costs more than computation. By integrating procesing at the sensor By integrating processing directly at the sensor - whether through Pixel Processor Arrays (PPAs) like Manchesterâ€™s SCAMP, stacked 3D sensors or analog processing - we can eliminate expensive data transfers and enable real-time operation at sub-watt power levels.</p>

<p>This workshop brings together researchers working on algorithms, architectures, and systems for on-sensor and near-sensor vision. Weâ€™ll explore what computation should happen on-sensor versus off-sensor, what representations sensors should output when they produce information rather than images, and how to co-design algorithms and hardware for next-generation vision systems.</p>
