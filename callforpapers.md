---

We invite submissions of **extended abstracts** and **live demonstrations** showcasing novel work in on-sensor and near-sensor vision. This is an opportunity to present early-stage research, works-in-progress, recently published results, or hardware prototypes to an audience of researchers working at the intersection of computer vision, computer architecture and near-memory processing.

### Submission Types 

**Extended Abstracts**
- Format :  To be Finalized 

**Live Demonstrations**
- Format : To be Finalized

Demos are strongly encouraged and will be given dedicated space during the workshop.

### Topics of Interest 
We welcome submissions on all aspects of on-sensor vision, including but not limited to: 

**Algorithms and Methods:**
- Algorithms for on or near sensor computer vision
- Cellular automata for vision
- On-sensor neural networks
- Bio-inspired vision sensing
- Graph algorithms for fine-grained parallelism
- Programming and learning for processing arrays
- Analog processing for computer vision

**Architectures and Systems:**
- Architectures for on-sensor / near-sensor (digital or analogue)
- Single layer and stacked architectures
- Architecture simulators (functional and hardware level)
- Dividing processing between on-sensor and off-sensor
- Communication between on-sensor and off-sensor processors (bandwidth and direction)
